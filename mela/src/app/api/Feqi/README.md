# feqi ASR Project

This project is a starter template for building an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system using PyTorch and deep learning.

## Project Structure
- `asr/` : Source code for ASR models and training scripts
- `data/` : Dataset and data processing scripts
- `models/` : Saved models and checkpoints

## Setup
1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install torch torchaudio librosa numpy
   ```
2. Start developing your ASR models in the `asr/` directory.

## Example Usage
See `asr/train.py` for a training script example.
